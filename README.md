Android Service Experiments

## Use AlarmManager to invoke broadcast receiver
### AlarmManager now throttles events to a minute (if under a minute)

## Demonstrate "BOOT_COMPLETED" broadcast to restart AlarmManager after reboot

## Demonstrate IntentService 
### Note onCreate/onDestroy for each invocation

## Demonstrate LocalService
### Note onCreate only on first invocation, never onDestroy
